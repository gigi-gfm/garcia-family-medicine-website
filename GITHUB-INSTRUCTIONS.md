# How to Push Your Website to GitHub

Your website is ready with your brand colors (#0066CC and #FF6600)! Follow these steps to push it to GitHub:

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com and log in
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Name it: `garcia-family-medicine` (or any name you prefer)
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize this repository with a README"
6. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd garcia-family-medicine

# Add the GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/garcia-family-medicine.git

# Rename branch to main (optional, modern convention)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Example with actual username:**
If your GitHub username is `GarciaFamilyMed`, the command would be:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/GarciaFamilyMed/garcia-family-medicine.git
```

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages (Optional - Free Hosting!)

To host your website for FREE on GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **"Settings"**
3. Scroll down to **"Pages"** in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select **"main"** branch
5. Click **"Save"**
6. Your website will be live at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/garcia-family-medicine/`
