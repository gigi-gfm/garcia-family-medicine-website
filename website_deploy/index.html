                        <p class="team-bio">Hi, I'm Dr. Tess. I am Mexican American and Native American. I think my most important characteristic as a doctor is the fact that I listen, when so many others don't have the time or worse, don't take the time. I graduated from the Medical College of Virginia in 2002 and became a board-certified Family Physician. I have basically spent my career being the "Family Doctor Near You" - serving in Lexington, Grain Valley, and now Blue Springs. I am also a board-certified obesity medicine physician. My career is dedicated to providing medical care to underserved people, influenced by my parents who dedicated their lives to helping the underserved. As a Direct Primary Care (DPC) physician, I am proud to offer a patient-first approach to medicine—one that eliminates the barriers of insurance and ensures my patients receive the time, attention, and personalized care they deserve.</p>

                        <p><strong>Revolutionary non-invasive electromagnetic therapy for pelvic floor strengthening and bladder control.</strong> FDA-cleared EMSELLA technology treats stress and urge incontinence in comfortable 28-minute sessions.</p>

                        <p><strong>What is CoreLift?</strong></p>
                        <p>CoreLift uses the FDA-cleared BTL EMSELLA chair, which delivers high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. You remain fully clothed while sitting comfortably in the chair during your 28-minute treatment session.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
                        <p>The EMSELLA chair causes thousands of supramaximal pelvic floor muscle contractions in a single session—the equivalent of doing thousands of Kegel exercises. These deep pelvic floor contractions restore neuromuscular control and strengthen the muscles that support your bladder and pelvic organs.</p>

                            <li><strong>Stress Incontinence:</strong> Leakage when coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercising</li>

                            <li><strong>Pelvic Floor Weakness:</strong> Following childbirth or due to aging</li>
                            <li><strong>Sexual Dysfunction:</strong> Improved pelvic muscle tone can enhance intimacy</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Recommended series: 6 sessions over 3 weeks</li>

                            <li>Fully clothed, non-invasive treatment</li>
                            <li>No downtime or recovery needed</li>
                            <li>Most patients see improvement after 3-4 sessions</li>

                        <p>Clinical studies show that 95% of patients report significant improvement in their quality of life. Many patients experience a dramatic reduction in pad usage, with some no longer needing pads at all. Results typically improve over 2-4 weeks following your treatment series.</p>

Mental health is part of our primary care membership. You will not be told that you need to seek a psychiatrist or therapist to receive care. Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment are provided by Dr. Garcia. Prescription and management of mental health medicines are also part of the primary care membership.</p>

                        <p><strong>Conditions We Treat:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="service-benefits">

                            <li><strong>Depression:</strong> Persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest</li>
                            <li><strong>Anxiety Disorders:</strong> Generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder</li>

                        <p><strong>Dr. Garcia's Philosophy of Counseling:</strong></p>
                        <p>Dr. Garcia's philosophy of counseling is unique, compassionate, and direct. It cannot be listed as any particular style but is something that she has developed over years of medical practice. She has learned that everyone has at least one point in their lives when they are in need of mental health support from someone who will listen with wisdom and understanding, who neither has an agenda nor a particular "style" or format into which the patient must fit. The patient is empowered to advocate for themselves, working with Dr. Garcia to discover the direction their counseling should go.</p>

                        <p><strong>Counseling Services:</strong></p>
                        <p>Some patients will do well with simple acknowledgment of a mental health issue. Other patients will require medication and management. There are some patients, however, who want or will require counseling. At Garcia Family Medicine, we do not refer you to a therapist; rather, Dr. Garcia provides counseling that is patient-specific and tailored to your individual needs.</p>
                        <ul class="service-benefits">
                            <li><strong>Individual Counseling:</strong> One-on-one sessions with Dr. Garcia ($85 per hour)</li>

                        <p>With DPC, patients pay a monthly membership fee that covers primary care services, which includes mental health care. This means patients have unlimited access to Dr. Tess without the need for co-pays or deductibles for mental health visits. Appointments often last 30 minutes to an hour, giving patients ample time to discuss their mental health issues, explore treatment options, and receive the care they need.</p>

                        <p>If you are looking for a 3-month program in which you starve yourself and use a GLP-1a to quickly take off pounds to get you into your bikini for the summer or fit into your wedding dress in time for the big day, our program is not for you. It takes time to change your eating habits so that once you come off the program, you will be able to maintain your weight loss. Our weight management program is for people who are committed to change.</p>

                        <p><strong>What Is Our Weight Management Program?</strong></p>
                        <p>Weight management at Garcia Family Medicine involves more than just losing pounds; it's about creating sustainable, healthy behaviors that reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension and allow the patient to come off the program without experiencing weight regain.</p>

                            <li><strong>24/7 Support:</strong> Dr. Tess and Gigi available by text or phone to support you through challenges</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>About Tirzepatide:</strong></p>
                        <p>Tirzepatide is more than just a GLP-1a agonist; it's also a GIP agonist. These hormones work in the GI system to make digestion slower, but also in the brain to decrease your appetite. Dr. Tess thoroughly evaluates each patient's eligibility before prescribing tirzepatide, ensuring that the treatment is safe, effective, and appropriate for their weight loss journey. You will not walk into the first appointment and walk out with tirzepatide—medical evaluation comes first.</p>

                        <p><strong>Program Timeline:</strong></p>
                        <p>Our weight management program is not a 3-month program or even a 6-month program. If you are using tirzepatide, it takes a month to taper you from one dose to the next. The need to increase the dose depends on your response to each level. Remember that it took you time to gain that weight and it will take you time to lose it. Rapid weight loss is by itself unhealthy and sets you up for rapid regain.</p>

                        <p><strong>Maintaining Your Weight Loss:</strong></p>
                        <p>Once you reach your target weight, it will take some months to taper you off of the tirzepatide. During that time, we will be focusing on maintaining healthy eating at a level that you will be able to maintain once you leave the program. Our program is designed not just to help patients lose weight but to sustain that loss.</p>

                        <p><strong>Why Choose Dr. Tess?</strong></p>
                        <p>Dr. Tess is a board-certified Obesity Medicine Specialist who has proven the program's effectiveness to herself by losing 70 pounds—without Tirzepatide, but with the coaching help of Gigi who lost 70 pounds with her. Knowing ourselves how important this is, we hold your hand every step of the way.</p>

                        <p><strong>Compassion and Acceptance:</strong></p>
                        <p>We believe that any weight management program that perpetuates feelings of shame or failure should not be in business. Compassion and acceptance are major parts of our weight management program. We do not allow you to be alone on your weight loss journey.</p>

                        <p class="team-bio">Hi, I'm Dr. Tess. I am Mexican American and Native American. I think my most important characteristic as a doctor is the fact that I listen, when so many others don't have the time or worse, don't take the time. I graduated from the Medical College of Virginia in 2002 and became a board-certified Family Physician. I have basically spent my career being the "Family Doctor Near You" - serving in Lexington, Grain Valley, and now Blue Springs. I am also a board-certified obesity medicine physician. My career is dedicated to providing medical care to underserved people, influenced by my parents who dedicated their lives to helping the underserved. As a Direct Primary Care (DPC) physician, I am proud to offer a patient-first approach to medicine—one that eliminates the barriers of insurance and ensures my patients receive the time, attention, and personalized care they deserve.</p>

                    <div class="service-short">
                        <p><strong>Revolutionary non-invasive electromagnetic therapy for pelvic floor strengthening and bladder control.</strong> FDA-cleared EMSELLA technology treats stress and urge incontinence in comfortable 28-minute sessions.</p>

                        <p><strong>What is CoreLift?</strong></p>
                        <p>CoreLift uses the FDA-cleared BTL EMSELLA chair, which delivers high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. You remain fully clothed while sitting comfortably in the chair during your 28-minute treatment session.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
                        <p>The EMSELLA chair causes thousands of supramaximal pelvic floor muscle contractions in a single session—the equivalent of doing thousands of Kegel exercises. These deep pelvic floor contractions restore neuromuscular control and strengthen the muscles that support your bladder and pelvic organs.</p>

                        <ul class="service-benefits">

                            <li>No downtime or recovery needed</li>
                            <li>Most patients see improvement after 3-4 sessions</li>

                        <p>Clinical studies show that 95% of patients report significant improvement in their quality of life.

                    <div class="service-short">
                        <p><strong>Prioritizing your cognitive and emotional well-being.</strong> Mental health is just as important as physical health, and at Garcia Family Medicine, mental health care is part of our regular primary care membership.</p>

                    <div class="service-full hidden">
                        <p><strong>What Is Mental Health Care?</strong></p>
                        <p>Mental health care focuses on maintaining and improving the psychological, emotional, and social well-being of individuals. Mental health conditions can range from mild anxiety and depression to more complex disorders such as bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Mental health impacts how we think, feel, and act, and can affect every aspect of life, from relationships to work performance.</p>

                        <p><strong>Integrated Into Your Primary Care:</strong></p>
                        <p>The patient seeking mental health care does not have to sign up for a special "mental health plan" at Garcia Family Medicine. Mental health is part of our primary care membership. You will not be told that you need to seek a psychiatrist or therapist to receive care. Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment are provided by Dr. Garcia. Prescription and management of mental health medicines are also part of the primary care membership.</p>

                        <p><strong>Conditions We Treat:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="service-benefits">
                            <li><strong>ADHD and ADD:</strong> Attention deficit disorders in children and adults</li>
                            <li><strong>Depression:</strong> Persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest</li>
                            <li><strong>Anxiety Disorders:</strong> Generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder</li>
                            <li><strong>Bipolar Disorder:</strong> Mood swings including emotional highs and lows</li>
                            <li><strong>PTSD:</strong> Post-traumatic stress disorder and trauma recovery</li>
                            <li><strong>OCD:</strong> Obsessive-compulsive disorder</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Dr. Garcia's Philosophy of Counseling:</strong></p>
                        <p>Dr. Garcia's philosophy of counseling is unique, compassionate, and direct. It cannot be listed as any particular style but is something that she has developed over years of medical practice. She has learned that everyone has at least one point in their lives when they are in need of mental health support from someone who will listen with wisdom and understanding, who neither has an agenda nor a particular "style" or format into which the patient must fit. The patient is empowered to advocate for themselves, working with Dr. Garcia to discover the direction their counseling should go.</p>

                        <p><strong>Counseling Services:</strong></p>
                        <p>Some patients will do well with simple acknowledgment of a mental health issue. Other patients will require medication and management. There are some patients, however, who want or will require counseling. At Garcia Family Medicine, we do not refer you to a therapist; rather, Dr. Garcia provides counseling that is patient-specific and tailored to your individual needs.</p>
                        <ul class="service-benefits">
                            <li><strong>Individual Counseling:</strong> One-on-one sessions with Dr. Garcia ($85 per hour)</li>

                        <p><strong>The DPC Advantage for Mental Health:</strong></p>
                        <p>With DPC, patients pay a monthly membership fee that covers primary care services, which includes mental health care. This means patients have unlimited access to Dr. Tess without the need for co-pays or deductibles for mental health visits. Appointments often last 30 minutes to an hour, giving patients ample time to discuss their mental health issues, explore treatment options, and receive the care they need.</p>

                        <p><strong>About Tirzepatide:</strong></p>
                        <p>Tirzepatide is more than just a GLP-1a agonist; it's also a GIP agonist. These hormones work in the GI system to make digestion slower, but also in the brain to decrease your appetite. Dr. Tess thoroughly evaluates each patient's eligibility before prescribing tirzepatide, ensuring that the treatment is safe, effective, and appropriate for their weight loss journey. You will not walk into the first appointment and walk out with tirzepatide—medical evaluation comes first.</p>

                        <p><strong>Program Timeline:</strong></p>
                        <p>Our weight management program is not a 3-month program or even a 6-month program. If you are using tirzepatide, it takes a month to taper you from one dose to the next. The need to increase the dose depends on your response to each level. Remember that it took you time to gain that weight and it will take you time to lose it. Rapid weight loss is by itself unhealthy and sets you up for rapid regain.</p>

                        <p><strong>Maintaining Your Weight Loss:</strong></p>
                        <p>Once you reach your target weight, it will take some months to taper you off of the tirzepatide. During that time, we will be focusing on maintaining healthy eating at a level that you will be able to maintain once you leave the program. Our program is designed not just to help patients lose weight but to sustain that loss.</p>

                        <p><strong>Why Choose Dr. Tess?</strong></p>
                        <p>Dr. Tess is a board-certified Obesity Medicine Specialist who has proven the program's effectiveness to herself by losing 70 pounds—without Tirzepatide, but with the coaching help of Gigi who lost 70 pounds with her. Knowing ourselves how important this is, we hold your hand every step of the way.</p>

                        <p><strong>Compassion and Acceptance:</strong></p>
                        <p>We believe that any weight management program that perpetuates feelings of shame or failure should not be in business. Compassion and acceptance are major parts of our weight management program. We do not allow you to be alone on your weight loss journey.</p>

                        <p class="team-bio">Hi, I'm Dr. Tess. I am Mexican American and Native American. I think my most important characteristic as a doctor is the fact that I listen, when so many others don't have the time or worse, don't take the time. I graduated from the Medical College of Virginia in 2002 and became a board-certified Family Physician. I have basically spent my career being the "Family Doctor Near You" - serving in Lexington, Grain Valley, and now Blue Springs. I am also a board-certified obesity medicine physician. My career is dedicated to providing medical care to underserved people, influenced by my parents who dedicated their lives to helping the underserved. As a Direct Primary Care (DPC) physician, I am proud to offer a patient-first approach to medicine—one that eliminates the barriers of insurance and ensures my patients receive the time, attention, and personalized care they deserve.</p>

                        <p><strong>Revolutionary non-invasive electromagnetic therapy for pelvic floor strengthening and bladder control.</strong> FDA-cleared EMSELLA technology treats stress and urge incontinence in comfortable 28-minute sessions.</p>

                        <p><strong>What is CoreLift?</strong></p>
                        <p>CoreLift uses the FDA-cleared BTL EMSELLA chair, which delivers high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. You remain fully clothed while sitting comfortably in the chair during your 28-minute treatment session.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
                        <p>The EMSELLA chair causes thousands of supramaximal pelvic floor muscle contractions in a single session—the equivalent of doing thousands of Kegel exercises. These deep pelvic floor contractions restore neuromuscular control and strengthen the muscles that support your bladder and pelvic organs.</p>

                            <li><strong>Stress Incontinence:</strong> Leakage when coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercising</li>

                            <li><strong>Pelvic Floor Weakness:</strong> Following childbirth or due to aging</li>
                            <li><strong>Sexual Dysfunction:</strong> Improved pelvic muscle tone can enhance intimacy</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Recommended series: 6 sessions over 3 weeks</li>
                            <li>Each session: 28 minutes</li>
                            <li>Fully clothed, non-invasive treatment</li>
                            <li>No downtime or recovery needed</li>
                            <li>Most patients see improvement after 3-4 sessions</li>

                        <p>Clinical studies show that 95% of patients report significant improvement in their quality of life. Many patients experience a dramatic reduction in pad usage, with some no longer needing pads at all. Results typically improve over 2-4 weeks following your treatment series.</p>

Mental health is part of our primary care membership. You will not be told that you need to seek a psychiatrist or therapist to receive care. Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment are provided by Dr. Garcia. Prescription and management of mental health medicines are also part of the primary care membership.</p>

                        <p><strong>Conditions We Treat:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="service-benefits">

                            <li><strong>Depression:</strong> Persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest</li>
                            <li><strong>Anxiety Disorders:</strong> Generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder</li>

                        <p><strong>Dr. Garcia's Philosophy of Counseling:</strong></p>
                        <p>Dr. Garcia's philosophy of counseling is unique, compassionate, and direct. It cannot be listed as any particular style but is something that she has developed over years of medical practice. She has learned that everyone has at least one point in their lives when they are in need of mental health support from someone who will listen with wisdom and understanding, who neither has an agenda nor a particular "style" or format into which the patient must fit. The patient is empowered to advocate for themselves, working with Dr. Garcia to discover the direction their counseling should go.</p>

                        <p><strong>Counseling Services:</strong></p>
                        <p>Some patients will do well with simple acknowledgment of a mental health issue. Other patients will require medication and management. There are some patients, however, who want or will require counseling. At Garcia Family Medicine, we do not refer you to a therapist; rather, Dr. Garcia provides counseling that is patient-specific and tailored to your individual needs.</p>
                        <ul class="service-benefits">
                            <li><strong>Individual Counseling:</strong> One-on-one sessions with Dr. Garcia ($85 per hour)</li>

                        <p>With DPC, patients pay a monthly membership fee that covers primary care services, which includes mental health care. This means patients have unlimited access to Dr. Tess without the need for co-pays or deductibles for mental health visits. Appointments often last 30 minutes to an hour, giving patients ample time to discuss their mental health issues, explore treatment options, and receive the care they need.</p>

                        <p>If you are looking for a 3-month program in which you starve yourself and use a GLP-1a to quickly take off pounds to get you into your bikini for the summer or fit into your wedding dress in time for the big day, our program is not for you. It takes time to change your eating habits so that once you come off the program, you will be able to maintain your weight loss. Our weight management program is for people who are committed to change.</p>

                        <p><strong>What Is Our Weight Management Program?</strong></p>
                        <p>Weight management at Garcia Family Medicine involves more than just losing pounds; it's about creating sustainable, healthy behaviors that reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension and allow the patient to come off the program without experiencing weight regain.</p>

                            <li><strong>24/7 Support:</strong> Dr. Tess and Gigi available by text or phone to support you through challenges</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>About Tirzepatide:</strong></p>
                        <p>Tirzepatide is more than just a GLP-1a agonist; it's also a GIP agonist. These hormones work in the GI system to make digestion slower, but also in the brain to decrease your appetite. Dr. Tess thoroughly evaluates each patient's eligibility before prescribing tirzepatide, ensuring that the treatment is safe, effective, and appropriate for their weight loss journey. You will not walk into the first appointment and walk out with tirzepatide—medical evaluation comes first.</p>

                        <p><strong>Program Timeline:</strong></p>
                        <p>Our weight management program is not a 3-month program or even a 6-month program. If you are using tirzepatide, it takes a month to taper you from one dose to the next. The need to increase the dose depends on your response to each level. Remember that it took you time to gain that weight and it will take you time to lose it. Rapid weight loss is by itself unhealthy and sets you up for rapid regain.</p>

                        <p><strong>Maintaining Your Weight Loss:</strong></p>
                        <p>Once you reach your target weight, it will take some months to taper you off of the tirzepatide. During that time, we will be focusing on maintaining healthy eating at a level that you will be able to maintain once you leave the program. Our program is designed not just to help patients lose weight but to sustain that loss.</p>

                        <p><strong>Why Choose Dr. Tess?</strong></p>
                        <p>Dr. Tess is a board-certified Obesity Medicine Specialist who has proven the program's effectiveness to herself by losing 70 pounds—without Tirzepatide, but with the coaching help of Gigi who lost 70 pounds with her. Knowing ourselves how important this is, we hold your hand every step of the way.</p>

                        <p><strong>Compassion and Acceptance:</strong></p>
                        <p>We believe that any weight management program that perpetuates feelings of shame or failure should not be in business. Compassion and acceptance are major parts of our weight management program. We do not allow you to be alone on your weight loss journey.</p>
