                            <h4>My Journey to Medicine</h4>
                            <p>I am Mexican American and Native American. I think my most important characteristic as a doctor is the fact that I listen, when so many others don't have the time or worse, don't take the time. I take tremendous pride in what I do, and this is my story.</p>
                            
                            <p>Believe it or not, my undergraduate degree was in music education, and my first career was as an elementary school music teacher. I went to music school in New Mexico, where my parents are from, and later taught on the Blackfeet Reservation in northern Montana, then ended up in the DC metropolitan area until I moved to Richmond, Virginia, to attend the Medical College of Virginia.</p>
                            
                            <h4>From Music Teacher to Family Doctor</h4>
                            <p>How did I get from music teacher to family doctor? It was sudden when my mother called me on Halloween 1993 and asked me why I wasn't in medical school. Within a week, I was enrolled for the next semester taking prerequisite coursework. Operating at the same breakneck speed, I took the MCAT exams in 1994 and started medical school in 1995.</p>
                            
                            <p>Basically, my mother's question was asked at the right time in my life, and it suddenly made perfect sense. I am a Sun Dancer, and I had never understood why I was called to be a dancer with what I was doing in my secular life. Then it dawned on me - the Native American Sun Dance is a healing ceremony. At that realization, becoming a doctor just fit that spiritual context and seemed like the natural culmination of my life. And I realized at that time that my career was going to be dedicated to providing medical care to underserved people.</p>
                            
                            <h4>My Professional Path</h4>
                            <p>I ended up in Missouri by matching for residency training at Truman Lakewood, formerly called Truman East. I graduated in 2002 and became a board-certified Family Physician. I worked for 5 years at the Samuel Rogers Community Health Center in Lexington, Missouri, then opened my own practice—the first woman doctor in Grain Valley in 2007, and now in Blue Springs. I have basically spent my career being the "Family Doctor Near You." During this time, I also became a board-certified obesity medicine physician.</p>
                            
                            <h4>A Heritage of Service</h4>
                            <p>My dad was in the Army, and that kept us moving when I was young, so really, I am from everywhere. I started public school in Germany and finished it in Alaska. My parents both came from humble Spanish families in northern New Mexico. My dad was the first member of his family to graduate from college. Their careers after dad got out of the Army have been dedicated to helping the underserved. Even after they retired, through work for their church, they continued to serve the immigrant communities. They celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary before my father passed on last year at the age of 92. I was greatly influenced by them. My desire to care for underserved patients was born in me. I was raised with it.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Here for You</h4>
                            <p>Right here in Blue Springs, near to you, you have a family medicine physician, an obesity medicine specialist, a compassionate primary care physician, a board-certified family physician, a Mexican American physician, and a Native American physician, all at one convenient location. As a Direct Primary Care (DPC) physician, I am proud to offer a patient-first approach to medicine—one that eliminates the barriers of insurance, provides affordable membership-based healthcare, and ensures my patients receive the time, attention, and personalized care they deserve. My mission is simple: to listen, to heal, and to serve.</p>

                            <h4>A Journey of Service and Compassion</h4>
                            <p>My journey has been one of service, creativity, and unwavering dedication to helping others. As a proud Filipina American, I've always been driven by a deep commitment to community and compassion—values that guide everything I do at Garcia Family Medicine.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Author & Advocate</h4>
                            <p>I'm the author of "Bahay Kubo," a children's book that celebrates Filipino culture and heritage. Through storytelling, I hope to inspire young readers to embrace their roots and understand the beauty of diversity. Currently, I'm working on my second book, continuing my mission to share stories that uplift and educate.</p>
                            
                            <h4>gigiSafeHOUSE: Serving Our Community</h4>
                            <p>Beyond my work at Garcia Family Medicine, I operate gigiSafeHOUSE, a nonprofit organization dedicated to serving community members in need. Whether providing resources, support, or simply a listening ear, gigiSafeHOUSE embodies my belief that everyone deserves dignity, care, and hope. This work is deeply personal to me, and it's what drives my passion for wellness coaching and patient advocacy.</p>
                            
                            <h4>From Learning to Leading</h4>
                            <p>Though I describe myself as a shy introvert, I've discovered incredible strength in stepping up for what matters. When our previous IT support was terminated, I took on the challenge of mastering GitHub, Netlify, PowerShell, and web development—despite having no prior experience. It wasn't easy, and there were many late nights of learning, but I was determined to ensure our practice could continue serving patients without interruption.</p>
                            
                            <h4>My Role at Garcia Family Medicine</h4>
                            <p>As Practice Manager and Wellness Coach, I wear many hats. I manage our operations, develop patient education materials, create marketing strategies, and work directly with patients on their wellness journeys. I believe in treating every patient like family, and I'm honored to be part of your healthcare experience. Whether you need help navigating insurance, understanding a treatment plan, or simply finding encouragement on your health journey, I'm here for you.</p>
                            
                            <p><em>My mission is simple: to create a welcoming, supportive environment where every patient feels heard, valued, and empowered to achieve their best health.</em></p>

                            <p><strong>Pelvic floor disorders affect millions of women</strong>, including urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, and pelvic organ prolapse. Research shows that at least 1 in 3 women experience these conditions, with prevalence increasing with age, childbirth, and menopause.</p>
                            
                            <div class="stat-highlight">
                                Treatment with CoreLift has shown symptom improvement rates of up to 82% for urinary urgency incontinence, 92% for nocturia, and 87% for bladder emptying issues.

                            <p>CoreLift with Emsella uses electromagnetic technology to stimulate pelvic floor muscles. You remain fully clothed and simply sit on the Emsella chair for 28 minutes. Most patients require 6 sessions over 3 weeks, with many noticing improvements after just 2-3 treatments.</p>
