Dr. Tess Garcia
Board Certified Family Medicine & Obesity Medicine

Hi, I'm Dr. Tess. I am Mexican American and Native American. I think my most important characteristic as a doctor is the fact that I listen, when so many others don't have the time or worse, don't take the time. I take tremendous pride in what I do, and I'm honored to serve our community with over 25 years of compassionate, comprehensive care.
