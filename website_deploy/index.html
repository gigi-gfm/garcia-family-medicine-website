Our Mission
Obesity isn't just a medical condition—it's a challenge affecting our families, our friends, our neighbors, and our entire community. Every day, we see people we love struggling with their health, their confidence, and their future.

At Garcia Family Medicine, our mission is to combat obesity right here in our community—one person, one family, one neighborhood at a time. We have to start somewhere. And that somewhere is with you.

We're not just treating a number on a scale. We're helping restore health, rebuild confidence, and reclaim lives. Because when you thrive, your family thrives. When families thrive, neighborhoods thrive. And when neighborhoods thrive, our entire community becomes stronger.

Let's start this journey together. For you. For your loved ones. For our community. 💙

⭐ Serving Our Community Since 2010 ⭐

gigiSafeHOUSE
Where Compassionate Care Meets Community Action

15 Years of Changing Lives
Since 2010, Garcia Family Medicine and gigiSafeHOUSE have worked together hand-in-hand to serve our community. For fifteen years, we've helped countless individuals and families access the quality healthcare they deserve—regardless of their financial situation. And we're just getting started.

✝️ A Testimony of Faith & Healing ✝️
In 2010, I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. In that dark moment, facing the greatest fear of my life, God spoke to my heart with a promise that would change everything: "I will heal you, if you work for Me."

God kept His promise. He healed me. And I have kept mine.

gigiSafeHOUSE was born from that sacred covenant—a promise made in faith, fulfilled through service. For fifteen years, I have worked for Him by serving His children. Every person we help, every barrier we remove, every family we support—this is my faithfulness to the God who healed me and called me to this work.

This isn't just a nonprofit. This is my testimony. This is my worship. This is how I honor the God who gave me my life back—by ensuring that healthcare, healing, and hope are available to everyone in our community, regardless of their ability to pay.

"For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me..." - Matthew 25:35-36

At Garcia Family Medicine, we believe that quality healthcare should never be out of reach because of financial hardship. That's why gigiSafeHOUSE exists—a nonprofit organization with a beautiful, synchronous relationship with our practice. Together, we're leaving a mark on the world—one person, one family, one community at a time.

Through gigiSafeHOUSE, we raise funds specifically to help people in our community who can't afford quality healthcare. Whether it's medical weight management, mental health counseling, or essential primary care services—financial barriers will never stand between you and the compassionate, comprehensive care you deserve.

How It Works
When you receive care at Garcia Family Medicine, you're not just a patient—you're part of a community committed to lifting each other up. gigiSafeHOUSE raises funds through donations, grants, and community partnerships to ensure that:

✓ No one is turned away due to inability to pay
✓ Essential services remain accessible to everyone in our community
✓ Financial hardship never prevents healing
✓ Everyone receives dignified, compassionate care
Living Out Our Mission
This is how we live out Dr. Tess's mission to treat the whole patient: spirit, body, and soul. It's not just about medical care—it's about ensuring that every person in Blue Springs, Jackson County, and the Kansas City Metro has access to health, hope, and healing.

Join Us in Making a Difference
Whether you need care, want to volunteer, or wish to support our mission through donations, gigiSafeHOUSE is here to ensure that healthcare is a right, not a privilege.
