                        <div class="team-bio-short">
                            <p class="team-bio">Hi, I'm Dr. Tess. I am Mexican American and Native American. I think my most important characteristic as a doctor is the fact that I listen, when so many others don't have the time or worse, don't take the time.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="team-bio-full hidden">
                            <p class="team-bio">I take tremendous pride in what I do, and this is my story.</p>
                            <p class="team-bio">Believe it or not, my undergraduate degree was in music education, and my first career was as an elementary school music teacher. I went to music school in New Mexico, where my parents are from, and later taught on the Blackfeet Reservation in northern Montana, then ended up in the DC metropolitan area until I moved to Richmond, Virginia, to attend the Medical College of Virginia. I ended up in Missouri by matching for residency training at Truman Lakewood, formerly called Truman East. I graduated in 2002 and became a board-certified Family Physician. I worked for 5 years at the Samuel Rogers Community Health Center in Lexington, Missouri, then opened my own practice, the first woman doctor in Grain Valley in 2007, and now in Blue Springs. I have basically spent my career being the "Family Doctor Near You." During this time, I also became a board-certified obesity medicine physician.</p>
                            <p class="team-bio">But that is just the geography of it all. How did I get from music teacher to family doctor? It was sudden when my mother called me on Halloween 1993 and asked me why I wasn't in medical school, but within a week, I was enrolled for the next semester taking prerequisite coursework. Operating at the same breakneck speed, I took the MCAT exams in 1994 and started medical school in 1995. Basically, my mother's question was asked at the right time in my life, and it suddenly made perfect sense. I am a Sun Dancer, and I had never understood why I was called to be a dancer with what I was doing in my secular life. Then it dawned on me - the Native American Sun Dance is a healing ceremony. At that realization, becoming a doctor just fit that spiritual context and seemed like the natural culmination of my life. And I realized at that time that my career was going to be dedicated to providing medical care to underserved people.</p>
                            <p class="team-bio">Now how I got to the dedication to caring for the underserved is kind of roundabout. My dad was in the Army, and that kept us moving when I was young, so really, I am from everywhere. I started public school in Germany and finished it in Alaska. My parents both came from humble Spanish families in northern New Mexico. My dad was the first member of his family to graduate from college. My mom was not the first on her side of the family, but she graduated too. Their careers after dad got out of the Army have been dedicated to helping the underserved. Even after they retired, through work for their church, they continued to serve the immigrant communities who attend that parish. They celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary before my father passed on last year at the age of 92. I was greatly influenced by them. You could say my desire to care for underserved patients was born in me. I was raised with it.</p>
                            <p class="team-bio">So, there it all is. Right here in Blue Springs, near to you, you have a family medicine physician, an obesity medicine specialist, a compassionate primary care physician, a board-certified family physician, a Mexican American physician, and a Native American physician, all at one convenient location. As a Direct Primary Care (DPC) physician, I am proud to offer a patient-first approach to medicine—one that eliminates the barriers of insurance, provides affordable membership-based healthcare, and ensures my patients receive the time, attention, and personalized care they deserve. My mission is simple: to listen, to heal, and to serve.</p>

                            <p class="team-bio">Hi, I'm Gigi. As a proud Filipina American, I've always been driven by a deep commitment to community and compassion—values that guide everything I do at Garcia Family Medicine.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="team-bio-full hidden">
                            <p class="team-bio"><strong>A Testimony of Faith & Healing:</strong> In 2010, I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. In that dark moment, facing the greatest fear of my life, God spoke to my heart with a promise that would change everything: "I will heal you, if you work for Me." God kept His promise. He healed me. And I have kept mine. gigiSafeHOUSE was born from that sacred covenant—a promise made in faith, fulfilled through service. For fifteen years, I have worked for Him by serving His children. Every person we help, every barrier we remove, every family we support—this is my faithfulness to the God who healed me and called me to this work.</p>
                            <p class="team-bio"><strong>Author & Advocate:</strong> I'm the author of "Bahay Kubo," a children's book that celebrates Filipino culture and heritage. Through storytelling, I hope to inspire young readers to embrace their roots and understand the beauty of diversity. Currently, I'm working on my second book, continuing my mission to share stories that uplift and educate.</p>
                            <p class="team-bio"><strong>gigiSafeHOUSE & Garcia Family Medicine:</strong> What many people don't realize is that gigiSafeHOUSE and Garcia Family Medicine share a beautiful, synchronous relationship. Through gigiSafeHOUSE, we raise funds specifically to help people who can't afford quality healthcare—ensuring that financial barriers never stand between someone and the compassionate, comprehensive care they deserve. This isn't just a nonprofit. This is my testimony. This is my worship.</p>
                            <p class="team-bio"><strong>From Learning to Leading:</strong> Though I describe myself as a shy introvert, I've discovered incredible strength in stepping up for what matters. When our previous IT support was terminated, I took on the challenge of mastering GitHub, Netlify, PowerShell, and web development—despite having no prior experience. It wasn't easy, and there were many late nights of learning, but I was determined to ensure our practice could continue serving patients without interruption.</p>
                            <p class="team-bio"><strong>My Role:</strong> As Practice Manager and Wellness Coach, I wear many hats. I manage our operations, develop patient education materials, create marketing strategies, and work directly with patients on their wellness journeys. I believe in treating every patient like family, and I'm honored to be part of your healthcare experience.</p>

                        <p>CoreLift uses the FDA-cleared BTL EMSELLA chair, which delivers high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. You remain fully clothed while sitting comfortably in the chair during your 28-minute treatment session.</p>

                        <p>The EMSELLA chair causes thousands of supramaximal pelvic floor muscle contractions in a single session—the equivalent of doing thousands of Kegel exercises. These deep pelvic floor contractions restore neuromuscular control and strengthen the muscles that support your bladder and pelvic organs.</p>

                    <h3>Mental Health Care: Prioritizing Your Cognitive and Emotional Well-Being</h3>
                    <div class="service-short">
                        <p>At Garcia Family Medicine, we understand that mental health is just as important as physical health. Mental health care involves addressing cognitive, social, and emotional well-being, ensuring that individuals can manage stress, connect with others, and maintain a balanced life. Mental health conditions—such as ADHD, ADD, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder—are common but often overlooked.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="service-full hidden">
                        <p>Our mental health care services are designed to provide ongoing support, helping individuals manage long-term mental health conditions in a compassionate and personalized manner. By utilizing the Direct Primary Care (DPC) model, we offer affordable, consistent, and high-quality mental health care without the burdens of traditional insurance systems and at a cost that makes it available to patients who have NO insurance. This model ensures that patients receive more time with Dr. Garcia and greater access to care. At Garcia Family Medicine, we recognize the importance of mental health care and provide a comprehensive approach to managing mental health conditions. Mental health is part and parcel of our regular primary care membership package and a component of every patient encounter.</p>

                        <p><strong>What Is Mental Health Care?</strong></p>
                        <p>Mental health care focuses on maintaining and improving the psychological, emotional, and social well-being of individuals. Mental health conditions can range from mild anxiety and depression to more complex disorders such as bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Mental health impacts how we think, feel, and act, and can affect every aspect of life, from relationships to work performance.</p>

                        <p>Mental health problems are more common than many people realize. In fact, millions of individuals around the world struggle with various mental health issues, yet many go undiagnosed or untreated due to the stigma surrounding mental health or the complexities of accessing affordable care. This is why Dr. Garcia keeps a sensitive and receptive ear open at every patient encounter for signs and symptoms of mental health concerns that are missed or misinterpreted by other providers. Often patients are afraid or embarrassed to come out and state that they have a mental health concern, making it important to recognize those calls for help that may be masked by physical symptoms. But she is just as careful not to assign a mental health diagnosis to physical symptoms that may require a more intensive medical evaluation.</p>

                        <p>The patient who is seeking mental health care does not have to sign up for a special "mental health plan" at Garcia Family Medicine. As stated above, it is part of our primary care membership. The patient will not be told that they need to seek a psychiatrist or therapist to receive care. Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment are provided by Dr. Garcia. Prescription and management of mental health medicines are also part of the primary care membership. The benefits of the direct primary care model roll into our mental health care, providing more time with Dr. Garcia for evaluation and closer follow-up, whether you are started on medicines or not, than can be expected in a traditional, insurance-based model.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Role of Counseling in Mental Health Care</strong></p>
                        <p>Some patients will do well with simple acknowledgment of a mental health issue and the part that it plays in their physical symptoms. Other patients will require medication and management of the medication in treatment of their mental health concern. There are some patients, however, who want or will require counseling. At Garcia Family Medicine, we do not refer you to a therapist; rather, Dr. Garcia provides counseling that is patient-specific and tailored to your individual needs. You may receive counseling in addition to medication prescription and management or counseling alone as the sole treatment for your mental health concerns. This is available to you for an additional counseling fee ($85 per hour), a fee that is amazingly competitive compared to traditional counseling. She also provides couples counseling.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Garcia's philosophy of counseling is unique, compassionate, and direct. It cannot be listed as any particular style but is something that she has developed over years of medical practice by working with all her patients, both those with medical concerns only and those who are specifically seeking mental health treatment. She has learned that everyone has at least one point in their lives when they are in need of mental health support from someone who will listen with wisdom and understanding, who neither has an agenda nor a particular "style" or format into which the patient must fit. The patient is empowered to advocate for themselves, working with Dr. Garcia to discover the direction their counseling should go.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Role of Direct Primary Care (DPC) in Mental Health Care</strong></p>
                        <p>The Direct Primary Care (DPC) model plays a vital role in improving access to mental health services by offering an affordable, patient-centered approach to care. In the traditional insurance-based model, mental health care is often expensive, complicated by co-pays, deductibles, referrals, and limited access to providers. Many patients experience long wait times before receiving treatment, limited time with their doctors, or annual limits on how many counseling sessions they may have, all of which hinder effective treatment. For the patient with NO insurance, the costs are even higher since insurance companies negotiate lower prices with medical and mental health practices and only pay a percentage of that lower price, leaving the patient paying their part of that percentage. The only people who pay full price in traditional medical practices are the patients with no insurance.</p>

                        <p>With DPC, patients pay a monthly membership fee that covers primary care services, which includes mental health care. This means that patients have unlimited access to Dr. Tess without the need for co-pays or deductibles. There is an additional fee per session ($85 for one hour) for counseling. At Garcia Family Medicine, we prioritize the doctor-patient relationship, ensuring that individuals receive the time, attention, and personalized care they need to address their medical and mental health concerns.</p>

                        <p><strong>Value of Time Spent with the Doctor in DPC vs. Traditional Insurance</strong></p>
                        <p>One of the most significant advantages of the Direct Primary Care model is the time that patients are able to spend with Dr. Garcia. In traditional insurance-based practices, doctors are often required to see a high volume of patients each day, leading to rushed appointments that may last only 10-15 minutes. This can make it difficult for patients to thoroughly discuss their mental health concerns or receive comprehensive care.</p>

                        <p>In contrast, DPC allows for longer, more personalized visits. Doctors in DPC practices typically have smaller patient panels, which means they can spend more time with each individual patient. Appointments (regular appointments, not counseling) often last 30 minutes to an hour, giving patients ample time to discuss their mental health issues, explore treatment options, and receive the care they need. This additional time is especially important for mental health care, as many conditions require a nuanced understanding of the patient's emotional and psychological well-being. With DPC, Dr. Garcia is able to build stronger relationships with her patients, make more accurate diagnoses, and develop more appropriate plans of care.</p>

                        <p>DPC emphasizes whole-person care, which means that Dr. Garcia takes the time to understand all aspects of a patient's health—physical, emotional, and mental. This is why mental health is part of our regular primary care membership plan. For individuals dealing with mental health issues, this approach ensures that they receive comprehensive care that addresses all facets of their well-being.</p>

                        <p><strong>Conclusion: DPC for Mental Health – A Path to Affordable, Comprehensive Care</strong></p>
                        <p>Mental health care is essential for living a balanced and fulfilling life. At Garcia Family Medicine, we believe that everyone should have access to high-quality mental health services, without the financial strain and limitations imposed by traditional insurance or the higher costs charged to the uninsured patient.</p>

                        <p>If you are looking for a 3-month program in which you starve yourself and use a GLP-1a to quickly take off pounds to get you into your bikini for the summer or fit into your wedding dress in time for the big day, our program is not for you. It takes time to change your eating habits so that once you come off the program, you will be able to maintain your weight loss. Our weight management program is for people who are committed to change.</p>

                        <p><strong>What Is Our Weight Management Program?</strong></p>
                        <p>Weight management at Garcia Family Medicine involves more than just losing pounds; it's about creating sustainable, healthy behaviors that reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension and allow the patient to come off the program without experiencing weight regain.</p>

                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>About Tirzepatide:</strong></p>
                        <p>Tirzepatide is more than just a GLP-1a agonist; it's also a GIP agonist. These hormones work in the GI system to make digestion slower, but also in the brain to decrease your appetite. Dr. Tess thoroughly evaluates each patient's eligibility before prescribing tirzepatide, ensuring that the treatment is safe, effective, and appropriate for their weight loss journey. You will not walk into the first appointment and walk out with tirzepatide—medical evaluation comes first.</p>

                        <p><strong>Program Timeline:</strong></p>
                        <p>Our weight management program is not a 3-month program or even a 6-month program. If you are using tirzepatide, it takes a month to taper you from one dose to the next. The need to increase the dose depends on your response to each level. Remember that it took you time to gain that weight and it will take you time to lose it. Rapid weight loss is by itself unhealthy and sets you up for rapid regain.</p>

                        <p><strong>Maintaining Your Weight Loss:</strong></p>
                        <p>Once you reach your target weight, it will take some months to taper you off of the tirzepatide. During that time, we will be focusing on maintaining healthy eating at a level that you will be able to maintain once you leave the program. Our program is designed not just to help patients lose weight but to sustain that loss.</p>

                        <p><strong>Why Choose Dr. Tess?</strong></p>
                        <p>Dr. Tess is a board-certified Obesity Medicine Specialist who has proven the program's effectiveness to herself by losing 70 pounds—without Tirzepatide, but with the coaching help of Gigi who lost 70 pounds with her. Knowing ourselves how important this is, we hold your hand every step of the way.</p>

                        <p><strong>Compassion and Acceptance:</strong></p>
                        <p>We believe that any weight management program that perpetuates feelings of shame or failure should not be in business. Compassion and acceptance are major parts of our weight management program. We do not allow you to be alone on your weight loss journey.</p>
