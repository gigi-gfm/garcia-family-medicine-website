                                <h4 style="color: #2c5282; margin-bottom: 10px;">Hi, I'm Dr. Tess.</h4>
                                
                                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">I am Mexican American and Native American. I think my most important characteristic as a doctor is the fact that I listen, when so many others don't have the time or worse, don't take the time. I take tremendous pride in what I do, and this is my story.</p>
                                
                                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Believe it or not, my undergraduate degree was in music education, and my first career was as an elementary school music teacher. I went to music school in New Mexico, where my parents are from, and later taught on the Blackfeet Reservation in northern Montana, then ended up in the DC metropolitan area until I moved to Richmond, Virginia, to attend the Medical College of Virginia.</p>
                                
                                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">I ended up in Missouri by matching for residency training at Truman Lakewood, formerly called Truman East. I graduated in 2002 and became a board-certified Family Physician. I worked for 5 years at the Samuel Rogers Community Health Center in Lexington, Missouri, then opened my own practice, the first woman doctor in Grain Valley in 2007, and now in Blue Springs. I have basically spent my career being the "Family Doctor Near You." During this time, I also became a board-certified obesity medicine physician.</p>
                                
                                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">But that is just the geography of it all. How did I get from music teacher to family doctor? It was sudden when my mother called me on Halloween 1993 and asked me why I wasn't in medical school, but within a week, I was enrolled for the next semester taking prerequisite coursework. Operating at the same breakneck speed, I took the MCAT exams in 1994 and started medical school in 1995. Basically, my mother's question was asked at the right time in my life, and it suddenly made perfect sense. I am a Sun Dancer, and I had never understood why I was called to be a dancer with what I was doing in my secular life. Then it dawned on me - the Native American Sun Dance is a healing ceremony. At that realization, becoming a doctor just fit that spiritual context and seemed like the natural culmination of my life. And I realized at that time that my career was going to be dedicated to providing medical care to underserved people.</p>
                                
                                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Now how I got to the dedication to caring for the underserved is kind of roundabout. My dad was in the Army, and that kept us moving when I was young, so really, I am from everywhere. I started public school in Germany and finished it in Alaska. My parents both came from humble Spanish families in northern New Mexico. My dad was the first member of his family to graduate from college. My mom was not the first on her side of the family, but she graduated too. Their careers after dad got out of the Army have been dedicated to helping the underserved. Even after they retired, through work for their church, they continued to serve the immigrant communities who attend that parish. They celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary before my father passed on last year at the age of 92. I was greatly influenced by them. You could say my desire to care for underserved patients was born in me. I was raised with it.</p>
                                
                                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">So, there it all is. Right here in Blue Springs, near to you, you have a family medicine physician, an obesity medicine specialist, a compassionate primary care physician, a board-certified family physician, a Mexican American physician, and a Native American physician, all at one convenient location. As a Direct Primary Care (DPC) physician, I am proud to offer a patient-first approach to medicine—one that eliminates the barriers of insurance, provides affordable membership-based healthcare, and ensures my patients receive the time, attention, and personalized care they deserve. My mission is simple: to listen, to heal, and to serve.</p>

                                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">My path to becoming a Practice Manager and Wellness Coach is deeply personal. I understand what it means to face health challenges because I've lived through them. My own journey through dental health issues and cancer treatment taught me invaluable lessons about resilience, the importance of holistic care, and the power of having someone in your corner who truly understands.</p>
                                
                                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">These experiences transformed my perspective on healthcare. I learned that healing isn't just about treating symptoms—it's about addressing the whole person: spirit, body, and soul. It's about having someone who listens without judgment, who celebrates your victories, and who walks beside you through the difficult moments. That's exactly what I bring to every patient interaction at Garcia Family Medicine.</p>
                                
                                <h4 style="color: #2c5282; margin: 15px 0 10px 0;">Celebrating Diversity Through Connection</h4>
                                
                                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">I'm proud of my Filipino heritage and the rich cultural traditions that have shaped who I am. I'm also a published children's book author—I wrote "Bahay Kubo," a book that celebrates Filipino culture and introduces children to the beautiful diversity of our world. This creative project reflects my belief that wellness extends beyond physical health to include cultural identity, creative expression, and community connection.</p>
                                
                                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">At Garcia Family Medicine, we serve patients from all backgrounds, and I bring a deep appreciation for diversity to my role. Whether you're navigating language barriers, cultural differences, or simply looking for someone who understands your unique journey, I'm here to ensure you feel welcomed, heard, and supported.</p>

                                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">As a Wellness Coach, I combine my personal health journey with evidence-based strategies to help you achieve your wellness goals.

I understand the challenges because I've faced them myself—and I know what it takes to overcome them.</p>
                                
                                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">My diverse background—from navigating my own health challenges to celebrating cultural heritage through creative writing—has equipped me with empathy, cultural competence, and a holistic understanding of wellness.

                                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">My commitment to helping others extends beyond the walls of Garcia Family Medicine. I founded gigiSafeHOUSE, a nonprofit organization dedicated to serving our neighbors and community members in need. While we're working at a small scale right now, our mission is big: to provide support, resources, and a safe haven for those facing difficult circumstances.</p>
                                
                                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Through gigiSafeHOUSE, I've learned that wellness isn't just about medical care—it's about having basic needs met, feeling safe, and knowing that someone cares. This work has deepened my understanding of the barriers many people face in accessing healthcare and reinforced my belief that true wellness requires addressing the whole person and their circumstances. These insights make me a more compassionate and effective Practice Manager and Wellness Coach.</p>
